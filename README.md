# GitTogether 🤝💻

GitTogether is a project-matching platform that helps students find collaborators to build real-world projects and gain hands-on experience.

Inspired by dating apps, GitTogether matches students based on skills, interests, learning goals, and availability — making it easier to turn ideas into shipped projects.

## 🚀 Features
- Create a developer profile (skills, interests, experience level)
- Post or browse project ideas
- Match with collaborators who share your goals
- Real-time chat to start building immediately
- Contribution-based scoring system (DevScore)
- AI-powered project idea generator

## 🧠 Problem We’re Solving
Students struggle to gain real-world experience because they lack an efficient way to find reliable and motivated collaborators. Existing platforms are outdated, unstructured, or resume-focused.

GitTogether focuses on **building together**, not just networking.
